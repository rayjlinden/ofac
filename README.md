[Office of Foreign Asset Control](https://www.treasury.gov/about/organizational-structure/offices/Pages/Office-of-Foreign-Assets-Control.aspx) (OFAC) is an HTTP API and Go library to download, [parse and serve United States OFAC sanction data](https://docs.moov.io/ofac/file-structure/) along with the [BIS Denied Person's List](https://bis.data.commerce.gov/dataset/Denied-Persons-List-with-Denied-US-Export-Privileg/xwtd-wd7a/data) (DPL) for applications and humans. Also supported is an async webhook notification service to initiate processes on remote systems connected with OFAC. The US Treasury department offers a [search page for OFAC records](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/).

All United States companies are required to comply with OFAC regulations and sanction lists and the US Patriot Act requires compliance with the BIS Denied Person's List (DPL). Moov's primary usage for this project is with ACH origination in our [paygate](https://github.com/moov-io/paygate) project.

To get started using OFAC download [the latest release](https://github.com/moov-io/ofac/releases/latest) or our [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/moov/ofac/tags). We also have a [demo OFAC instance](https://moov.io/ofac/) as part of Moov's demo environment.

We offer [hosted api docs as part of Moov's tools](https://api.moov.io/#tag/OFAC) and an [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/moov-io/ofac/blob/master/openapi.yaml) for use with generated clients.

Docs: [docs.moov.io](https://docs.moov.io/ofac/) | [api docs](https://api.moov.io/apps/ofac/)

### Web UI

OFAC ships with a web interface for easier access searching the records. Our Docker image hosts the UI by default, but you can build and run it locally as well.

![](docs/images/webui.png)

```
$ make
...
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -o ./bin/server github.com/moov-io/ofac/cmd/server
...
npm run build
...
Success!

$ go run ./cmd/server/ # Load http://localhost:8084 in a web browser
```

### Configuration

| Environmental Variable | Description | Default |
|-----|-----|-----|
| `OFAC_DATA_REFRESH` | Interval for OFAC data redownload and reparse. `off` disables this refreshing. | 12h |
| `OFAC_DOWNLOAD_TEMPLATE` | HTTP address for downloading raw OFAC files. | (OFAC website) |
| `DPL_DOWNLOAD_TEMPLATE` | HTTP address for downloading the DPL | (BIS website) |
| `INITIAL_DATA_DIRECTORY` | Directory filepath with initial files to use instead of downloading. Periodic downloads will replace the initial files. | Empty |
| `WEBHOOK_BATCH_SIZE` | How many watches to read from database per batch of async searches. | 100 |
| `LOG_FORMAT` | Format for logging lines to be written as. | Options: `json`, `plain` - Default: `plain` |
| `BASE_PATH` | HTTP path to serve API and web UI from. | `/` |
| `HTTP_BIND_ADDRESS` | Address for OFAC to bind its HTTP server on. This overrides the command-line flag `-http.addr`. | Default: `:8084` |
| `HTTP_ADMIN_BIND_ADDRESS` | Address for OFAC to bind its admin HTTP server on. This overrides the command-line flag `-admin.addr`. | Default: `:9094` |
| `HTTPS_CERT_FILE` | Filepath containing a certificate (or intermediate chain) to be served by the HTTP server. Requires all traffic be over secure HTTP. | Empty |
| `HTTPS_KEY_FILE`  | Filepath of a private key matching the leaf certificate from `HTTPS_CERT_FILE`. | Empty |
| `DATABASE_TYPE` | Which database option to use (Options: `sqlite`, `mysql`) | Default: `sqlite` |
| `WEB_ROOT` | Directory to serve web UI from | Default: `examples/ofac-search-ui/build/` |

#### Storage

Based on `DATABASE_TYPE` the following environment variables will be read to configure connections for a specific database.

##### MySQL

- `MYSQL_ADDRESS`: TCP address for connecting to the mysql server. (example: `tcp(hostname:3306)`)
- `MYSQL_DATABASE`: Name of database to connect into.
- `MYSQL_PASSWORD`: Password of user account for authentication.
- `MYSQL_USER`: Username used for authentication,

Refer to the mysql driver documentation for [connection parameters](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#dsn-data-source-name).

- `MYSQL_TIMEOUT`: Timeout parameter specified on (DSN) data source name. (Default: `30s`)

##### SQLite

- `SQLITE_DB_PATH`: Local filepath location for the paygate SQLite database. (Default: `ofac.db`)

Refer to the sqlite driver documentation for [connection parameters](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3#connection-string).

### Features

- Download OFAC and BIS Denied Persons List (DPL) data on startup
  - Admin endpoint to [manually refresh OFAC and DPL data](docs/runbook.md#force-data-refresh)
- Index data for searches
- Async searches and notifications (webhooks)
- Manual overrides to mark a `Company` or `Customer` as `unsafe` (blocked) or `exception` (never blocked).
- Library for OFAC and BIS DPL data to download and parse their custom files

#### Webhook Notifications

When OFAC sends a [webhook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) to your application the body will contain a JSON representation of the [Company](https://godoc.org/github.com/moov-io/ofac/client#Company) or [Customer](https://godoc.org/github.com/moov-io/ofac/client#Customer) model as the body to a POST request. You can see an [example in Go](examples/webhook/webhook.go).

An `Authorization` header will also be sent with the `authToken` provided when setting up the watch. Clients should verify this token to ensure authenticated communicated.

Webhook notifications are ran after the OFAC data is successfully refreshed, which is determined by the `OFAC_DATA_REFRESH` environmental variable.

##### Watching a specific Customer or Company by ID

OFAC supports sending a webhook periodically when a specific [Company](https://api.moov.io/#operation/addCompanyWatch) or [Customer](https://api.moov.io/#operation/addCustomerWatch) is to be watched. This is designed to update another system about an OFAC entry's sanction status.

##### Watching a customer or company name

OFAC supports sending a webhook periodically with a free-form name of a [Company](https://api.moov.io/#operation/addCompanyNameWatch) or [Customer](https://api.moov.io/#operation/addCustomerNameWatch). This allows external applications to be notified when an entity matching that name is added to the OFAC list. The match percentage will be included in the JSON payload.

##### Prometheus Metrics

- `http_response_duration_seconds`: A Histogram of HTTP response timings
- `ofac_match_percentages` A Histogram which holds the match percentages with a label (`type`) of searches
   - `type`: Can be address, q, remarksID, name, altName
